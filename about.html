        <p>Hey there, I’m Curtis. I’m a twenty one year old musician and game designer from Ohio and this is my hub for all my projects. I’ve been making music and videogames since I was ten. </p> 
        
        <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life and more often than not I’m either composing, playing an instrument or listening to it. I can play the clarinet, keyboard and guitar. I’m currently a senior at the University of Akron as a Composition and Woodwind Performance double major. My music projects can be found on my music page.</p>

        <p>Ever since I finished my first game “Robobot”, I knew I was hooked. I became obsessed with making games and over time I’ve been able to grow and develop my style. I like to make surreal horror narrative games. You can see my games on my game page. </p>

        <p>Sometimes I do other things like painting or writing. You can find these side projects on my other page along with various inspirations for my work.</p>
